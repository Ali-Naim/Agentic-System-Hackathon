  ## Overview
This project implememnts LLM-based agent that converts unstructured PDFs into interactive graph structures. 
We use an LLM agent to answer user queries by traversing the graph, enabling reasoning across document content.
Graphs allow us to capture relationships between concepts, sections, and keywords.
In summary, the Educational Tutor:
•	Takes lecture notes (text or PDF),
•	Converts them into a knowledge graph,
•	Allows the user to ask educational questions, and
•	Returns contextually grounded answers by reasoning over the graph.

## Features

LLM-powered question answering
